## 4: Type Aliases

In this example, we'll create another Generic `Tuple` type... But this time, we'll assign it to a variable:

[examples/04_type_aliases.py](https://github.com/pluralsight/intro-to-python-typing/examples/04_type_aliases.py)

If you find yourself defining large Tuples, or have a Tuple definition that you need to repeat, assigning the type definition to a variable can make life easier!

You can now refer to it by a (hopefully) shorter name, and only maintain a single copy the tuple definition in your code.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is usually good advice, and giving variables meaningful names helps make your code more readable. It's good stuff, all around!
